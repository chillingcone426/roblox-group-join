# roblox-group-join
This is a very simple system that joins a group via the roblox api. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to do it and thought I may as well give it to everyone.
#Setup Proccess
First, create a account on https://capbypass.com
Next add a dollar to your account.
Next, copy your api key. 
Next, go into group.js and input your api-key where it says apikey here
Next, add your roblox cookie to all requested spots
Next you simply just run it!
